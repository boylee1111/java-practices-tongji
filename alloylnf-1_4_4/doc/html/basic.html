<h2>Basic usage of the Alloy Look&amp;Feel</h2>
                    
<p>Before using the Alloy Look&amp;Feel make use that these requirements are
fulfilled:</p>
                   
<ul>
            <li>You must be using a Java&#8482; Runtime Environment version 1.3 
or      higher or a Java&#8482; Development Kit version 1.3 or higher.</li>
            <li>The file <i>alloy.jar</i> must be included into the classpath 
  of  your      application</li>
     <li>You must have your license code available<br>
     </li>
                        
</ul>
                   
<p>For using the Alloy Look&amp;Feel in your application, you will first have
to unlock the Alloy Look&amp;Feel by setting the license code property (Learn
more about properties <a href="properties.html">here</a>). Then you have
to tell     the class javax.swing.UIManager that you want to use the AlloyLook&amp;Feel.
    <br>
 </p>
 
<p>This whole process is done by the following code:         </p>
                    
<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="2" border="0" width="100%">
         <tbody>
           <tr>
             <td valign="top" bgcolor="#ebe9e7">                        
                        <code>com.incors.plaf.alloy.AlloyLookAndFeel.setProperty("alloy.licenseCode",
   "x#myCompany#skd23j#dsjd9");<br>
                   try {<br>
      &nbsp; javax.swing.LookAndFeel alloyLnF = new com.incors.plaf.alloy.AlloyLookAndFeel();<br>
      &nbsp; javax.swing.UIManager.setLookAndFeel(alloyLnF);<br>
                   } catch (javax.swing.UnsupportedLookAndFeelException ex) 
 {<br>
      &nbsp; // You may handle the exception here<br>
                   }<br>
            </code>  </td>
           </tr>
                           
  </tbody>       
</table>
                    
<p>   These lines must be called before any Swing components are created.</p>
             
<p><b>Important:</b> Since version 1.1 the license file <i>alloylnf.lic</i>
is not    needed anymore if you are setting the license code property as
shown in  the  code. For backwards compatibility reason the license file
can still be used instead of setting the license property.<br>
       <br>
       </p>
                    
<h3>Changing the look and feel at runtime or setting the look and feel after
     Swing components were created</h3>
                    
<p>Changing the look and feel at runtime or setting the look and feel after
     some Swing components were created is quite tricky. There are quite
some     pitfalls, especially with "orphan" components, which will be explained
 below.<br>
          <br>
          If you want to change the look and feel at runtime or if you want 
 to  set  the look and feel after some Swing components were created, you 
will  have  to update the UIs of all created components after changing the 
look  and feel.  This can be done by calling the method <code>updateUI()</code>
   of each <code>JComponent</code>,  which is quite cumbersome if there are
  a few hundred components around. A  more convenient way is to call the
method    <code>updateComponentTreeUI(Component  c)</code> of the class <code>javax.swing.SwingUtilities</code>.
   This will  update the UIs of all components in the component tree below
 the  specified  component. Make sure that you call this method for all windows
   and frames,  to ensure that all components will be updated.<br>
          <br>
          The class <code>com.incors.plaf.alloy.AlloyLookAndFeel</code> provides
    the  static method <code>updateAllUIs()</code>, which can be used to
update     all  available Frames and Windows with only one method call. This
is the    most convienient way of updating all UIs, but it does not allow
an update    of only part of the component hierarchy.<br>
          <br>
          This code shows how to change an applcation's look and feel to
the   Alloy    Look&amp;Feel during runtime:<br>
          <br>
          </p>
                    
<table cellpadding="10" width="100%">
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td bgcolor="#ebe9e7">                            <code>try 
 {<br>
     &nbsp; javax.swing.LookAndFeel alloyLnF = new com.incors.plaf.alloy.AlloyLookAndFeel();<br>
     &nbsp; javax.swing.UIManager.setLookAndFeel(alloyLnF);<br>
     &nbsp; com.incors.plaf.alloy.AlloyLookAndFeel.updateAllUIs();<br>
                    } catch (javax.swing.UnsupportedLookAndFeelException
ex)   {<br>
     &nbsp; // You may handle the exception here<br>
                    }           </code></td>
              </tr>
                                       
  </tbody>          
</table>
                    
<p><br>
          <b>Be aware of "orphan" components:</b> Watch out for components
 that   are  not part of the component tree. These are components that have
 been  created,  but not added to the component hierarchy yet. Since they
are not  part of the component hierarchy, they are not reached when the component 
 tree is updated. On these "orphan" components the method <code>updateComponentTreeUI(Component
     c)</code> of the class <code>javax.swing.SwingUtilities</code> has to
 be   called separately to make sure that their UIs are updated, too.<br>
          </p>
          <b>Be aware of layout changes:</b> When switching between different 
  look  and feels during runtime, the layout of your application can become 
  corrupted  due different space requirements of the components when displayed 
  with different  look and feels. One way to ensure the correct layout it 
to  call validate()  on the top level containers after changing the look and
feel.<br>
