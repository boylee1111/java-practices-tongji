<h2>Using Look&amp;Feel Frame Decorations<br>
        </h2>
               
<h3>Basics</h3>
     Since version 1.2 the Alloy Look&amp;Feel supports outer Frame decorations 
  that match the look of the Alloy Look&amp;Feel. This functionality is only 
  available when used with JRE/JDK versions 1.4 or higher.<br>
    <br>
    Example for a look&amp;feel decorated frame:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/decoration-lnf.png" alt="Look&amp;Feel Decoration"
 width="466" height="76">
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The same frame with native decoration:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/decoration-native.png" alt="Native Decoration"
 width="466" height="79">
    <br>
     <br>
    <br>
    <br>
     There are two ways to enable the look&amp;feel frame decorations:<br>
     <br>
         
<ol>
       <li>Call the methods <code>JFrame.setDefaultLookAndFeelDecorated(true)</code> 
  and <code>JDialog.setDefaultLookAndFeelDecorated(true) </code>in your application<code>.
      </code>This will result in each new JFrame and JDialog having the decorations 
 provided by the Alloy Look&amp;Feel. Note that both methods are only available 
 since  JRE/JDK 1.4. With JRE/JDK 1.3 and 1.3.1 a <code>NoSuchMethodException</code>
  will be thrown.</li>
       <li>Set the property <code>"alloy.isLookAndFeelFrameDecoration"</code> 
  to <code>"true"</code>. Look at the <a href="properties.html">section about
  properties</a> to learn how to set a property in the Alloy Look&amp;Feel.
  Using a property for setting the look&amp;feel frame decoration has the
advantage  that you are independant of the JRE/JDK version. For version 1.3
and 1.3.1  the property will just be ignored.</li>
         
</ol>
      <br>
         
<h3>Notes</h3>
     The look&amp;feel frame decorations has certain limitations that you 
should   know about. Read this first before using the look&amp;feel frame 
decorations   in your application to avoid surprising behaviour.<br>
     <br>
         
<ul>
       <li>The look&amp;feel frame decorations finally honor the minimum
size   of a frame, which is a very nice feature, but it can also result in
strange   effects in some cases. The reason for this is that one of the parameters
 used for calculating the minimum size of a frame is the minimum size of
the  frame's content pane. In some cases the minimum size of a content pane
can  differ depending on its current size, which leads to different minimum
sizes  of a frame for different resizing operations. A simple workaround
for this  problem is to set the minimum size of &nbsp;the content pane to
a fixed value,  which can look like this:<br>
         <br>
           
    <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="0" width="100%">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" bgcolor="#ebe9e7"><code>Container contentPane
 = myFrame.getContentPane();<br>
  if (</code><code>contentPane</code><code> instanceof JComponent) {<br>
     &nbsp; ((JComponent)&nbsp;</code><code>contentPane</code><code>).setMinimumSize(new
 Dimension(100,  100));<br>
     }</code><br>
            </td>
          </tr>
               
      </tbody>          
    </table>
      <code><br>
         </code></li>
       <li>Please note that in order to remove all decorations from a frame, 
you will have to call <code>myFrame.getRootPane().setWindowDecorationStyle(JRootPane.NONE)</code> 
in addition to <code>myFrame.setUndecorated(false)</code>. The method <code>setUndecorated(false)</code> 
only removes the <i>native</i> decorations from the frame, but is does not 
affect the decoration style provided by the look and feel.<br>
   </li>
       <li>Unlike native decorations the system menu of the look&amp;feel 
frame   decoration does not alloy choosing an input method (e.g. for Japanese 
text   input). This affects only very few applications, but you should be 
aware  of it. Currently we are investigating if there is a way to provide 
this functionality  with look&amp;Feel frame decorations.</li>
  <li>If you prefer to use the "classic" style of frame buttons that was
used until Alloy 1.3.1 you can set this via setting the property "alloy.frameButtonStyle"
to "classic". Details can be found in the <a href="properties.html">section
about properties</a>.<br>
  </li>
         
</ul>
