<h2>Using the Alloy Look&amp;Feel with Java&#8482; WebStart</h2>
     There are some special issues that you have to remember when using the 
 Alloy  Look&amp;Feel with a Java&#8482; WebStart enabled application.<br>
     <br>
         
<h3>The Classloader issue</h3>
    There is an issue with the class loader that occurs with all custom look
  and feels. Fortunately it can be solved easily.<br>
    <br>
    To use the Alloy Look&amp;Feel in a Java&#8482; WebStart application you will 
 have to set the class loader, which is very simple to do. Here is an example:<br>
     <br>
       
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="0" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top" bgcolor="#ebe9e7"><code> try {<br>
      &nbsp; javax.swing.LookAndFeel alloyLnF = new com.incors.plaf.alloy.AlloyLookAndFeel();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        <br>
      &nbsp; javax.swing.UIManager.setLookAndFeel(alloyLnF);<br>
      } catch (javax.swing.UnsupportedLookAndFeelException ex) {<br>
      &nbsp; // You may handle the exception here<br>
      }<br>
      // this line needs to be implemented in order to make JWS work properly<br>
      javax.swing.UIManager.getLookAndFeelDefaults().put("ClassLoader", getClass().getClassLoader());</code><br>
          </td>
        </tr>
               
  </tbody>    
</table>
    <code></code><br>
     The last line in the code is one that does the trick by setting the
classloader   for the look and feel to the classloader of the class that
contains the code.  You might have to change <code>getClass()</code> to <code>MyClass.class</code>
  (where <code>MyClass</code> has to be replaced by the actual class name)
 if you have to put the code into a static method. <br>
     <br>
         
<h3>Running your application in the sandbox</h3>
     If you are running your application as an untrusted application in the 
 Java  WebStart sandbox you should set the property <code>isSandbox</code> 
 to <code>true</code>.  Otherwise you will run into problems when you are 
using a <code>FileOpenService</code>  or a <code>FileSaveService</code>. Refer
to the <a href="properties.html">section about properties</a> to learn how
to set the property.<br>
     <br>
     Note that you only should set the property <code>isSandbox</code> to 
<code>true</code>   if your application is really running in the sandbox. 
For Web Start applications that are not running in a sandbox, the property 
should not be set.<br>
