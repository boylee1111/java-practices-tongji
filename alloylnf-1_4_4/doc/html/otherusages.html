<h3> </h3>
<h3><a name="Default_Look_and_Feel"></a>Setting the Alloy Look&amp;Feel
as a JRE's Default Look&amp;Feel</h3>
Making the Alloy Look&amp;Feel the default look and feel of your Java&#8482;
Runtime Environment is quite easy. <br>
<br>
First you have to put the file <i>alloy.jar</i> into the folder <i>/lib/ext</i>
of your JRE. Then you have to create a properties file with the name
alloy.properties, which contains at least the license code
property. The file <i>alloy.properties</i> is a simple text file which
contains this one line of text:<br>
<br>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="0" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" bgcolor="#ebe9e7"><code>alloy.licenseCode=[license
Code]</code><br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
where <i>[license Code]</i> must be replaced by your license code.
This file must be put into a jar archive. You can use the jar utility
that comes with the JDK or simply create a zip archive with your
favorite zip tool, add the properties file to the zip archive and
replace the .zip suffix of the archive with .jar. This jar has to be
put into the folder <i>/lib/ext</i> of your JRE, too. It does not
matter which name you give to the jar archive that contains the
alloy properties file, as long as it ends with <i>.jar </i>. To
make it clear what is inside the jar we usually call it <i>alloyProperties.jar</i>.<br>
<br>
The last thing you need to do is to create another properties file,
with the name <i>swing.properties </i>. This file is also a simple
text file which contains the following text:<br>
<br>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="0" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" bgcolor="#ebe9e7"><code>swing.installedlafs =
motif,windows,metal,mac,alloy <br>
swing.installedlaf.motif.name = CDE/Motif <br>
swing.installedlaf.motif.class =
com.sun.java.swing.plaf.motif.MotifLookAndFeel <br>
swing.installedlaf.windows.name = Windows <br>
swing.installedlaf.windows.class =
com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows.WindowsLookAndFeel <br>
swing.installedlaf.metal.name = Metal <br>
swing.installedlaf.metal.class =
javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel <br>
swing.installedlaf.mac.name = Mac <br>
swing.installedlaf.mac.class =
com.sun.java.swing.plaf.mac.MacLookAndFeel <br>
swing.installedlaf.alloy.name = Alloy <br>
swing.installedlaf.alloy.class = com.incors.plaf.alloy.AlloyLookAndFeel<br>
swing.defaultlaf=com.incors.plaf.alloy.AlloyLookAndFeel</code><br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<code></code>The file <i>swing.properties</i> has to be put into the
folder <i>/lib</i> of your JRE.<br>
<br>
If you followed these instructions, Swing applications that run on your
JRE should now use the Alloy Look&amp;Feel as their default look and
feel.<br>
<br>
<h3>Using the Alloy Look&amp;Feel with IntelliJ IDEA</h3>
To use the Alloy Look&amp;Feel with IntelliJ IDEA you will first have
to find the JRE that is being used by&nbsp;IntelliJ IDEA on your
system. By default the used JRE can be found in the subfolder /jre of
the IntelliJ IDEA program folder. Add the Alloy Look&amp;Feel to that
JRE as described in the section <a href="#Default_Look_and_Feel">"Setting
the Alloy Look&amp;Feel as an JRE's Default Look&amp;Feel"</a>. Then
start IDEA and select Alloy from the combo box in
Options-&gt;IDE-Settings-&gt;Appearance-&gt;Look And Feel.<br>
<br>
<h3>Using the Alloy Look&amp;Feel with Netbeans</h3>
To use the the Alloy Look&amp;Feel with netbeans all you have to do is
to follow these two steps:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Put the file <i>alloy.jar</i> into the <i>lib/ext/</i> folder
of
netbeans.</li>
  <li>Add the following to the text of the file <i>ide.cfg</i>, which
is located in the <i>bin/</i> folder of netbeans (if the file <i>ide.cfg</i>
does not exist, simply create an empty text file with that name).<code><br>
    <br>
-ui com.incors.plaf.alloy.AlloyLookAndFeel
-J-Dalloy.licenseCode=[license code]</code><br>
    <br>
The part <i>[license code]</i> must be replaced by your license code.
Please be aware that the license code cannot be put in quotation
marks, because netbeans does not recognize them properly.</li>
</ol>
That all you have to do. Netbeans should now use the Alloy
Look&amp;Feel as the default look and feel.<br>
<br>
<h3>Using the Alloy Look&amp;Feel with JBuilder</h3>
To use the Alloy Look&amp;Feel with JBuilder you will first have to
find the JRE that is being used by JBuilder on your computer. By
default the used JRE is located in the JBuilder program folder (there
is no /jre folder, only /lib and /bin). Add the Alloy Look&amp;Feel to
that JRE as described in the section <a href="#Default_Look_and_Feel">"Setting
the Alloy Look&amp;Feel as an JRE's Default Look&amp;Feel"</a>. Then
start JBuilder and set the look and feel in Tools-&gt;IDE
Options-&gt;Browser-&gt;Look and Feel.<br>
